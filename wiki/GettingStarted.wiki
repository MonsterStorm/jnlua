#summary Geting Started

=Installing JNLua=

JNLua can be [http://code.google.com/p/jnlua/downloads/list downloaded] from its web site. The download directory contains two types of assemblies:
 
  * `bin`: these contain the JNLua Java library as a JAR file 
  * `src`: these contain the JNLua source code 

To get started, you will need both a `bin` file and a `src` file.
 
=Installing the Lua Library=

The JNLua native library requires Lua as a shared library. Depending on your environment, you can install the shared Lua library via a package manager, download it from the [http://luaforge.net/projects/luabinaries/ LuaBinaries] project, or compile the [http://www.lua.org/download.html Lua source code] into a shared library yourself.
 
==Lua Version==

JNLua 0.9 requires Lua 5.1.

JNLua 1.0 requires Lua 5.2.

==Installation Directory==

The Lua library must be placed in a location where is is found when the Java Virtual Machine loads the JNLua native library. Typical locations inlcude:
 
  * *Win32*: `C:\Windows\System32`
  * *Linux*: `/usr/lib` 
  * *MacOSX*: `/usr/lib`

=Installing the JNLua Native Library=

The JNLua project no longer provides pre-built native libraries. Please see [BuildingTheNativeLibrary Building The Native Library] for information on how to build the JNLua native library.
 
==Installation Directory==

The JNLua native library must be placed in a location where is is found by the Java Virtual machine. Typical locations include:
 
  * *Win32*: `C:\Windows\System32`
  * *Linux*: `/usr/lib`
  * *MacOSX*: `/Library/Java/Extensions`

See your JVM documentation for a list of these locations on your platform. As as alternative, you can ensure that the location where you have installed the JNLua native library is on your `java.library.path`. 

=Launching the JNLua Console=

To launch the JNLua console, type the following in the directory where `jnlua-{version}.jar` is installed:
 
{{{
java -classpath jnlua-{version}.jar com.naef.jnlua.console.LuaConsole 
}}}

To exit the console, terminate the input. On Windows, this is accomplished by typing *F6* followed by *Enter*. On Linux, type *Ctrl+D*.
